# Major Project Backend

Welcome to the backend repository for the Major Project. This backend is built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB/MySQL**. It forms the core of the project, handling business logic, database operations, authentication, and providing RESTful API endpoints for seamless interaction with the frontend.

## Overview
The backend is designed to be modular, scalable, and secure. Key features include user authentication, role-based authorization, CRUD operations, error handling, and middleware implementation. This backend follows best practices for maintaining code quality, modularity, and security.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication and Authorization**:
  - Secure login using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**
  - Role-based access control (Admin, Customer, etc.)

- **Database Integration**:
  - Support for **MongoDB** or **MySQL** (select based on your project requirements)
  - ORM integration with **Mongoose** (for MongoDB) or **Sequelize** (for MySQL)

- **RESTful APIs**:
  - Provides API endpoints for managing project entities such as users, bookings, and other business logic

- **Middleware**:
  - Custom middleware for logging, authentication, error handling, and input validation

- **Environment Configuration**:
  - Configured using `.env` file for easy management of environment-specific variables

- **Error Handling**:
  - Global error handling to provide consistent error responses and debugging support

- **API Documentation**:
  - Clear documentation of all available API endpoints

## Tech Stack

The backend is powered by the following technologies:

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications
- **Express.js**: Lightweight and flexible web application framework
- **MongoDB/MySQL**: Database options for data persistence
- **Mongoose/Sequelize**: ORM for database interaction
- **JWT**: Token-based authentication for enhanced security
- **ESLint and Prettier**: Code quality and formatting tools

## Getting Started

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager)
- **MongoDB** or **MySQL** server running locally or remotely

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aryan88111/Major_Project_Backend.git
   cd Major_Project_Backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root folder and add the following variables:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   DB_URI=your_database_uri_here
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
   ```

4. **Run Database Migrations (if using SQL)**
   For MySQL:
   ```bash
   npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
   ```

5. **Start the Server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. **Access the Server**
   The server will be running at:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

## API Documentation

The backend provides the following core API endpoints:

### Authentication Endpoints

- **POST** `/api/auth/register`
  - **Description**: Register a new user
  - **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "username": "string",
      "password": "string",
      "email": "string"
    }
    ```
  - **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "User registered successfully",
      "user": {
        "id": "user_id",
        "username": "string",
        "email": "string"
      }
    }
    ```

- **POST** `/api/auth/login`
  - **Description**: Log in an existing user
  - **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "username": "string",
      "password": "string"
    }
    ```
  - **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "token": "jwt_token",
      "user": {
        "id": "user_id",
        "username": "string",
        "email": "string"
      }
    }
    ```

### User Management Endpoints

- **GET** `/api/users`
  - **Description**: Retrieve a list of all users
  - **Response**:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "id": "user_id",
        "username": "string",
        "email": "string",
        "role": "string"
      }
    ]
    ```

- **DELETE** `/api/users/:id`
  - **Description**: Delete a user by ID

### Example Extended Endpoints
Add additional endpoints relevant to your project's business logic, such as booking flights, managing products, or handling transactions.

## Folder Structure

The project follows a modular folder structure to maintain scalability and readability:

```
Major_Project_Backend
â”œâ”€â”€ controllers    # API route logic
â”œâ”€â”€ models         # Database models
â”œâ”€â”€ routes         # API route definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ middleware     # Custom middleware (e.g., logging, authentication)
â”œâ”€â”€ config         # Configuration files (e.g., database, JWT)
â”œâ”€â”€ utils          # Utility functions (e.g., input validation, token generation)
â”œâ”€â”€ public         # Static files (if any)
â”œâ”€â”€ .env           # Environment variables
â”œâ”€â”€ app.js         # Main application file
â””â”€â”€ README.md      # Project documentation
```

## Development Best Practices

- **Code Quality**: Follow linting rules (ESLint) and formatting standards (Prettier)
- **Security**: Implement secure authentication and input validation
- **Modularity**: Keep controllers, models, and routes organized
- **Error Handling**: Use centralized error handlers for debugging and consistent responses
- **Version Control**: Commit frequently with meaningful commit messages

## Testing

Consider adding automated tests using **Jest** or **Mocha** to ensure code reliability and prevent regressions:

1. Install testing dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest supertest
   ```

2. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
